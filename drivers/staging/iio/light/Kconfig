config SENSORS_GP2A_IIO
	tristate "Sharp Light Sensor"
	depends on I2C && GPIOLIB
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the sharp sensor.
	  This driver provides ambient light.
config SENSORS_GP2A_IIO_PROX
	tristate "Sharp Proximity Sensor"
	depends on SENSORS_GP2A_IIO
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the sharp sensor.
	  This driver provides distacne.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called gp2a030a.
config SENSORS_ISL29018
        tristate "ISL 29018 light and proximity sensor"
        depends on I2C
        default n
        help
         If you say yes here you get support for ambient light sensing and
         proximity infrared sensing from Intersil ISL29018.
         This driver will provide the measurements of ambient light intensity
         in lux, proximity infrared sensing and normal infrared sensing.
         Data from sensor is accessible via sysfs.

config SENSORS_TSL2563
	tristate "TAOS TSL2560, TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Taos TSL2560,
	 TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called tsl2563.

config TSL2583
	tristate "TAOS TSL2580, TSL2581 and TSL2583 light-to-digital converters"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Provides support for the TAOS tsl2580, tsl2581 and tsl2583 devices.
	 Access ALS data via iio, sysfs.
