	  This driver supports the Invensense MPU devices.
	  This includes MPU6050/MPU3050/MPU9150/ITG3500/MPU6500/MPU9250.
	  This driver can be built as a module. The module will be called

	default n
	help
	  This is slave device enable MPU3050 accelerometer slave device.
	  Right now, it is only bma250. For other acceleromter device,
	  it can be added to this menu if the proper interface is filled.
	  There are some interface function to be defined.

config INPUT_MPU6500_SELFTEST
	bool "Self-test of Invensense MPU-6500 sensor"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for self-test of the MPU-6500 sensor
	  device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called MPU6500.
